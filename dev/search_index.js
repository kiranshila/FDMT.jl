Instead of imaging a supposed unchanging sky, radio astronomers are now looking for short timescale (from a few milliseconds to several seconds) signatures. For some of these phenomenon, like FRBs, the high-energy process that generates these signatures is not yet known. Detecting these signatures and combining with data from other telescopes and scientific efforts (like LIGO) may unlock brand new understandings to the nature of our universe.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","title":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","text":"For most of these radio transients, the source star is usually galaxies away. As the source generated a broadband RF pulse, the propagation of that pulse through ionized interstellar media disperses that pulse in time. In otherwords, the propagation of the EM wave through this plasma introduces a frequency-dependent time shift. This is commonly reffered to as the \"sad trombone\" effect as instead of recieving all the frequencies all at once, you recieve a descending sweep.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","title":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","text":"The shape of this sweep, or how quickly it descends is characterized by the dispersion measure (DM) of the pulse. Low DM pulses can have very little sweep, approaching a normal wideband pulse while high DM pulses can take seconds to sweep across all the bands. As the amount of dispersion is directly related to how much interstellar media it travelled through, we can conclude that the high DM pulses come from very far away.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","title":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","text":"It's easy to look at pulses once the dispersion has been removed (\"dedispersed\"), but it's difficult to find dispersed pulses in dynamic spectra. That's where libraries such as this one come in to play. By looking at many possible DMs over the chunk of dynamic spectra, we can find the one that maximizes the frequency-integrated power. That is to say, when there exists a dispersed pulse in the spectra, applying the correct DM transfromation to dedisperse and integrating across frequency will result in a power maximum.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","title":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","text":"This is what we want to find.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/#Getting-the-Data","page":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","title":"Getting the Data","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","title":"Using FDMT to Find a Radio Transient","text":"We'll be playing with data from Chris Bochenek's STARE2 project.
